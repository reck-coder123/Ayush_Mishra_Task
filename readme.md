# HODLINFO Project
HODLINFO is a project that provides real-time cryptocurrency ticker information. It fetches data from the WazirX API and allows users to view the latest prices, buy and sell rates, volume, and other details for different cryptocurrencies.

## Project Overview
The HODLINFO project consists of a client-side frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a server-side backend built with Node.js and Express. The frontend interacts with the backend to fetch cryptocurrency data and display it to the user.

The project follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend is responsible for the user interface and interaction, while the backend handles data fetching from the WazirX API, database operations, and serving the API endpoints.

## Running the Project
To run the HODLINFO project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install the required dependencies for both the server and client.

Start the Server: Navigate to the server directory by running cd server. Then, start the server by running npm start. This will launch the backend server on a specified port (e.g., http://localhost:3001).

Launch the Frontend: Open index.html in the client/Template folder using a live server or by opening it in a web browser directly. This will load the frontend and connect it to the backend server.

## Explore the App: 
You can now interact with the HODLINFO app by selecting different cryptocurrencies from the dropdown menu and viewing the real-time ticker data. Additionally, you can switch between dark and light modes for a personalized visual experience.

Please note that you might need to configure the server port and other settings based on your environment and preferences.

That's it! You can now explore the HODLINFO project and enjoy real-time cryptocurrency ticker information with the convenience of dark and light modes.
